<!-- Bootstrap will figure out how
wide your screen is and respond by
resizing your HTML elements - hence the name Responsive Design.
With responsive design, there is no
need to design a mobile version of your website.
It will look good on devices with screens of any width.
You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code
to the top of your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>

We're going to start exercises using bootstrap and build on our cat photo app: -->

<div class=container-fluid> <!-- we added this to our div elemt at the top -->
 <h2 class="red-text text-center">CatPhotoApp</h2> <!-- multiple classes have a
   space between them in the "". This centers out header -->

  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats"
  class="img-responsive"
  alt="Three kittens running towards the camera. ">
  <!-- this will make the picture adjust to the width of the screen -->
  <button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button>
 <!-- this creates a button with whatever text I want. the btn-block class makes
it as wide as the screen and the button primary -->
<button class="btn btn-block btn-info">Info </button>
<!-- The btn-info class is used to call attention to optional
actions that the user can take. -->
<button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button>
<!-- The btn-danger class is the button color you'll
use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action,
such as deleting a cat photo. -->

<!-- we can make a simple grid system with <div class="row" col-md-*> in our div element.
This is colums - medium - # of colums. Medium spcifies the size of the screen! -->

<!-- we can also put all of our buttons in a row by giving them their own div element-->
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-4">
  <button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button>
    </div>
      <div class="col-xs-4">
  <button class="btn btn-block btn-info">Info</button>
    </div>
        <div class="col-xs-4">
  <button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button>
    </div>

<!-- By using the span element, you can put several elements together,
and even style different parts of the same element differently.
Below, I used it to put the header and image next to each other, note how the
image resizes itself!-->

  <div class="row">
    <div class = "col-xs-8">
  <h2 class="text-primary text-center">CatPhotoApp</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "col-xs-4">
  <a href="#"><img class="img-responsive thick-green-border"
    src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat"
    alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. "></a>
    </div>
  </div>
<!-- the most important part is that to start, theres a <div> and the each
element on the row ALSO gets a div element -->












</div>
